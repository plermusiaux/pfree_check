Implementation of a method to verify pattern elimination in CTRS

Please see https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02476012/ for more details

How to compile the web version:

 * install nix
 * run `nix-env -iA cachix -f https://cachix.org/api/v1/install`
 * run `cachix use miso-haskell`
 * in the repo, run `nix-build`
 * copy result/bin/pfreecheck.jsexe/all.js in out and start index.html 


The execution returns a map of not semantics preserving rules of the CTRS
together with terms whose ground semantics are included in the deep semantics of the
right-hand side but that do not satisfy the pattern-free property required
by the left-hand side.

You can create your own example files for testing.
Do not hesitate to look at existing example files for syntax guidance.
