Implementation of a method to verify pattern elimination in CTRS

Please see https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02476012/ for more details

Compilation instruction:
$ ghc Main

Execution instruction:
The execution take a path towards a file to parse and analyze
$ ./Main example_file

The execution returns a map of not semantics preserving rules of the CTRS
with terms, which ground semantics are included in the deep semantics of the
right-hand side, but that do not satisfy the pattern-free property required
by the left-hand side.

You can create your own example files for testing.
Do not hesitate to look at existing example files for syntax guidance.
